Amplicon-Seq Pipeline
================

The standard MUGQIC Amplicon-Seq pipeline is suited for Metagenome analysis (e.g. ITS, 16S or 18S rDNA analysis).
This pipeline is based on OTU picking method using [Qiime](http://qiime.org). 
First of all, reads are preprocessed by removing trailing low quality with Trimmomatic. Then (assuming we 
have paired end data), the reads are merged with FLASh. Finally a reference chimera dectection is performed in
order to filter out chimeric sequences possibly formed during amplicon sequencing.
Reads are then clustered into different OTU according to a chosen treshold with VSEARCH. Each OTU is represented
by a single sequence and taxonomic assignation is performed using Uclust. A phylegonetic tree is then built 
with PyNAST which can be useful for beta diversity metrics.
A normalization step (rarefaction or CSS) is then performed in order to compare all the samples and to analyse the alpha and the beta 
diversity. 
Plots for alpha diversity are made with Qiime and Krona tools. Also, Qiime is utilised for beta diversity analysis.

A summary html report is automatically generated by the pipeline. This report contains description
of the sequencing experiment as well as a detailed presentation of the pipeline steps and results.
Various Quality Control (QC) summary statistics are included in the report and additional QC analysis
is accessible for download directly through the report. The report includes also the main references
of the software and methods used during the analysis, together with the full list of parameters
that have been passed to the pipeline main script.

An example of the Amplicon-Seq report for an analysis on public data  is available for illustration purpose only:
[Amplicon-Seq report](http://gqinnovationcenter.com/services/bioinformatics/tools/dnaReport/index.html).

1- trimmomatic
--------------
Raw reads quality trimming and removing of Illumina adapters is performed using [Trimmomatic](http://www.usadellab.org/cms/index.php?page=trimmomatic).
If an adapter FASTA file is specified in the config file (section 'trimmomatic', param 'adapter_fasta'),
it is used first. Else, 'Adapter1' and 'Adapter2' columns from the readset file are used to create
an adapter FASTA file, given then to Trimmomatic. For PAIRED_END readsets, readset adapters are
reversed-complemented and swapped, to match Trimmomatic Palindrome strategy. For SINGLE_END readsets,
only Adapter1 is used and left unchanged.
