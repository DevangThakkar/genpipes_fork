# This configuration file describes the relation between the various steps of
# the pipeline. The predecessor(s) for each node are described below using a
# certain set of schema. The numbers refer to the step indicated by the number
# whereas a hyphen ("-") refers to external data being used. There are two
# types of connectors relating the predecessors for a certain node:
#
# ",": The node considers exactly one of the mentioned predecessors.
# Example: Step 2:trimmomatic needs exactly one of either (i) the FASTQ files
# or (ii) the converted FASTQ files from step 1, with (i) preferred over (ii)
#
# "+": The node needs at least one of the predecessors but considers multiple
# predecessors, if present.
# Example: Step 9:picard_mark_duplicates considers as input, all of the output
# files created in step 5, 6, and 8 - at least one of them being necessary.
#
# Notes:
# Any line beginning with a hash (#) is considered to be a comment.
# Do not use spaces/tabs between the step number and step name
#
