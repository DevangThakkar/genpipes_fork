Introduction
------------

This document contains the description of the current MUGQIC DNA-Seq analysis. The information presented here reflects the current state of the analysis as of $date$.

The DNA sequencing performed at the Innovation center generated between 40 to 63 million paired reads per library using the illumina Hiseq 2000/2500 sequencer. The protocol used for preparing libraries is the wholeGenome protocol. Base calls are made using the Illumina CASAVA pipeline. Base quality is encoded in phred 33.
