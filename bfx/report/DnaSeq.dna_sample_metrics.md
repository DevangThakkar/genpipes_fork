### Sequencing and Alignment Metrics per Sample

General summary statistics are provided per sample. Sample readsets are merged for clarity.

* Raw Reads: total number of read obtained from the sequencer
* Surviving Reads: number of remaining reads after the trimming step
* Surviving %: Surviving reads / Raw reads
* Mapped reads: number of aligned read aligned
* Mapped %: Mapped reads / Surviving reads
* Unique Reads: number of not duplicated read entries
* Duplicate Reads: number of duplicated read entries providing alternative coordinates
* Duplicate %: Duplicate / Mapped reads
* Pair Orientation: library paired-end read design
* Mean Insert Size: mean distance between the left most base position of the read1 and the right most base position of the read 2
* Standard Deviation: standard deviation of distance between the left most base position of the read1 and the right most base position of the read 2
* WG Mean Coverage: total number of aligned read / size of the genome
* WG %_bases_above_10: total number of bases with a coverage >= 10x / size of the genome
* WG %_bases_above_25: total number of bases with a coverage >= 25x / size of the genome
* WG %_bases_above_50: total number of bases with a coverage >= 50x / size of the genome
* WG %_bases_above_75: total number of bases with a coverage >= 75x / size of the genome
* WG %_bases_above_100: total number of bases with a coverage >= 100x / size of the genome
* WG %_bases_above_500: total number of bases with a coverage >= 500x / size of the genome
* CCDS Mean Coverage: total number of aligned read in the CCDS/capture region / size of the CCDS/capture region
* CCDS %_bases_above_10: total number of bases with a coverage >= 10x in the CCDS/capture region / size of the CCDS/capture region
* CCDS %_bases_above_25: total number of bases with a coverage >= 25x in the CCDS/capture region / size of the CCDS/capture region
* CCDS %_bases_above_50: total number of bases with a coverage >= 50x in the CCDS/capture region / size of the CCDS/capture region
* CCDS %_bases_above_75: total number of bases with a coverage >= 75x in the CCDS/capture region / size of the CCDS/capture region
* CCDS %_bases_above_100: total number of bases with a coverage >= 100x in the CCDS/capture region / size of the CCDS/capture region
* CCDS %_bases_above_500: total number of bases with a coverage >= 500x in the CCDS/capture region / size of the CCDS/capture region
